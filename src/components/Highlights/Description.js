          A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience.[1] The
          performance may be by a single musician, sometimes then called a
          recital, or by a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, choir, or
          band. Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings, from
          private houses and small nightclubs, dedicated concert halls, arenas
          and parks to large multipurpose buildings, and even sports stadiums.
          Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena
          concerts or amphitheatre concerts. Informal names for a concert
          include show and gig.
